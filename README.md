# BREATHTAKING

### ABOUT

Hello dudes. This is my first and sole pet-project for educational purposes. It has been created in the distant 2016, in 13 November to be precise

If you took note of project's name, it differs from the current. Ideologically, it was a photo-sharing service for cats only, something like Instagram. But not for now, I have some thoughts about a photographer community, where you may share your breathtaking photos and follow other beauty gazers, [unsplash](https://unsplash.com) comes to mind.
You might think, why not just create another one? Dunno, I feel a nostalgic reminiscence type of way with this project, moreover, it's a good design refactoring practice. Actually, it doesn't matter what it is, and I'm not trying to declare it will be production-viable. First of all, the key purpose is to grok edge web technologies and tools

Last but not least, my great thanks to [@nickskalkin](https://github.com/nickskalkin) for mentoring all the way up
